-   **How can I change map styles?**\
    Map styles are controlled by settings made in the ArcPro project files stored in `RiverArchitect/02_Maps/CONDITION/maps_CONDITION_design.aprx`. Developers recommend to adapt the `background` image connections prior to mapping in the template project file `RiverArchitect/02_Maps/templates/maps_CONDITION_design.aprx`.


-   **What is a *condition*?**\
    A *condition* refers to a planning state that is typically characterized by a 4-digits year indicator, followed by a layer specifier. *Condition*al Rasters (*GeoTIFF* format) are stored in `RiverArchitect /01_Conditions/`. For more information, refer to [Signposts](Signposts#conditions).
